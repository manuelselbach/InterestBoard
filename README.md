What is this about
------------------
The InterestBoard is a public realtime pin board that collects ideas around the topics of 
your interests.
You can open as many boards you like. Everybody can add new elements to contribute to a 
board and helps out to grow the collection.

All contributors can vote on topics to keep them on top.  

Collect, rate and Discuss
------------------
Items on a pin board, name it links, pictures, and text nodes aren't nothing more than useless bits of items unless you can collaborate on them. Then the items will become priority. 

For example: you want to know everything new and hot about the mother city Cape Town. Enter /board/capetown. Every Item is ordered and placed on a grid that bring's the most important and most recently items up.
If someone adds an annotation to an Item, say the link of the best traveling blog you see his interaction in realtime, so you can dive into the whole experience of working together collecting the things you like.  

Everyone who is on the same board as you can directly interact with your posts. You can see all other actions and start a conversation-like reposting.

Language support
------------------
Currently InterestBoard supports the english and the german language. I implement the localisations with node's [i18n](https://github.com/mashpie/i18n-node) module. 

If you speake an other language, please translate the /locales/[your-lang].json file and commit the code. 

Installation
------------------
Just run <pre><code>npm install</code></pre> Everything should be in place.  To run the Application say <pre><code>node app.js</code> or <code>npm start</code></pre>

Open and free
------------------
Social-Networks should be open! Everybody has to see what's going on and how the data flow. That is the fundamental of trust into a network. 

Releasing the source code is not a problem at all. The goal is to enforce the critical mass of users on a portal, not the genius craftsmanship of the engineers work. Many people can code. And these people are for hiring. So , The code is not the challenge, it's the ecosystem.

Testing
------------------
run <pre><code>npm test</code></pre> to test the current source.

Licence 
------------------
If you found this tool helpful please use it. It's free and you can do whatever you want. You can - if you want - remove the comments and names. You can reverse it upside down or print it out and let your dog chew on it. Do whatever you like - i do not care. But please, one last thing: please commit your fixes, that i can get your optimisation back to my build chain. Keep your (maybe commercial features, but share bug fixes an performance improvements with me)
